# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The play, Fever, created by Louise almost reached it's fundraising goal within a short period of time. Louise wants to compare the different campaign results in relation to their launch dates and funding goals.

### Purpose
The purpose of the project is to create tables and visualizations to compare and analyze the results of different campaigns in relation to their corresponding launch date and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Some important highlights of the Kickstarter data based on lanch dates are as follows: Out of 1369 Theater Kickstaters, 839 were sucessful (61% of total), 493 have failed (36%), and 37 were cancled (3%) between the months of Jan - Dec. The top 3 most successful months (greatest to least) were May, Jun, and Jul with 111, 100, and 87 respectively.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Examing some key points from the Outcomes Based on Goals, the general trend is that the larger the Kickstarter goal is, the less succesfull it becomes. A noticable exception to this are the goals between $35,000 to $44,999 which has a 67% success rate however the number of total projects only make up less than 1% of the total volume. Goals less than $5,000 were the most successful with the most volume with an average of 74% success rate and a 73% volume composition.   

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
No challenges or difficulties were encountered but, the analysis may have been difficult if the result data metrics were random or had very little consistancy. Random data would not be able to provide enough of a pattern to make any productive analysis to be used for future Kickstarter campaigns.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Based upon the data, the kickstarter for Theaters were overall fairly successful overall. The majority of which were most successful during the Spring and Summer Months. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Based upon the data, the kickstater goals were most successful with amounts less than $5,000. Most of the goals greater than $20,000 were unsuccessfull.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

The extreme majority of the Goals are less than $1,000 which makes analysis on any goal greater than that less analytically significant. The data doesn't provide any demographics of those participating in the kickstarter thus limiting the extent of the analysis.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

A pie chart based upon the Goals and Outcome would be useful in getting a sense of the overall revenue obtained from the Kickstater.
