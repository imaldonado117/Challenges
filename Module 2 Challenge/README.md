# VBA Challenge

## Overview of Project

In this project will be refactoring the the current Module 2 solution code. Making it more efficient and capable of handling larger data sets quickly.

### Purpose

The purpose is to expand the original project to analyze the entire stock market over the last few years. However, the current VBA script was not codded to handle the large volume of data. The code needs to be change to efficiently and quickly analyze the entire data set.
## Results

Based upon the data generated for 2017, DQ, SEDG, ENPH, and FSLR have the highest returns. It is noted that WQ isn't traded often as it has the lowest volume at about 36M. The previously mentioned stocks have about average trade volume (214M) except FSLR which has the second highest trade value at 684M. This suggests that DQ stocks were often held for long periods of time to get higher returns while the others were traded very often, possibly for short periods of time, and produced high returns.

Based upon the data generated for 2018, most of previously mentioned high returns stocks have experienced a huge drop in returns (130%-140% decrease on average). DQ, SEDG, and FSLR are currently at a 36.7% average loss in returns. The exception is ENPH which only lost about 40% in return value and maintains a very high return value at about 82%.

## Summary

- What are the advantages and disadvantages of refacorting code in general?
- How do these compare to the original VBA script?
